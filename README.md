<p> As shown in the video,this application leverages machine learning models to predict heart failure risks, and helps the customer understand how various factors affect the heart.

<p>
 In this application, we study the effects of average hearbeat per minute,palpitations per day,cholesterol,BMI,Age,Sex,Family History, Smoker for the last 5 years,excercice min per week to determine how much of a difference these factors can make on your risk of heart failure. By using our application, customers see the radical difference in their lifestyle choices they make to avoid the risk of heart failure. By leveraging AI and machine learning, we help customers understand just how much their cholestrol level, smoking habits, excercise and BMI  increases or decreases their risk ailure, by predicting whether they are prone  or not prone to heart failure.
#Description
<p>
 Using IBM AutoAI, you automate all the tasks involved in building predictive models for different requirements. You see how AutoAI generates great models quickly which save time and effort and aid in faster decision-making process. You create a model that from a data set that includes the average hearbeat per minute,palpitations per day,cholesterol,BMI,Age,Sex,Family History, Smoker for the last 5 years,excercice min per week  to predict the risk of heart failure.

<p>When you have completed this code pattern, you understand how to:

-Setup, quickly, the services on IBM Cloud for building the model.
-Ingest the data and initiate the AutoAI process.
-Build different models using AutoAI and evaluate the performance.
-Choose the best model and complete the deployment.
-Generate predictions using the deployed model by making REST calls.
-Compare the process of using AutoAI and building the model manually.
-Visualize the deployed model using a front-end application.
